Subject: [PATCH 1/2] stdlib: Suppress gcc diagnostic that char8_t is a keyword
 in C++20 in uchar.h.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

gcc 13 issues the following diagnostic for the uchar.h header when the
-Wc++20-compat option is enabled in C++ modes that do not enable char8_t
as a builtin type (C++17 and earlier by default; subject to _GNU_SOURCE
and the gcc -f[no-]char8_t option).
  warning: identifier ‘char8_t’ is a keyword in C++20 [-Wc++20-compat]
This change modifies the uchar.h header to suppress the diagnostic through
the use of '#pragma GCC diagnostic' directives for gcc 10 and later (the
-Wc++20-compat option was added in gcc version 10).  Unfortunately, a bug
in gcc currently prevents those directives from having the intended effect
as reported at https://gcc.gnu.org/PR106423.  A patch for that issue has
been submitted and is available in the email thread archive linked below.
