Subject: [PATCH 22/22] nscd: Fix netlink cache invalidation if epoll is used
 [BZ #29415]

Processes cache network interface information such as whether IPv4 or IPv6
are enabled. This is only checked again if the "netlink timestamp" provided
by nscd changed, which is triggered by netlink socket activity.

However, in the epoll handler for the netlink socket, it was missed to
assign the new timestamp to the nscd database. The handler for plain poll
did that properly, copy that over.

This bug caused that e.g. processes which started before network
configuration got unusuable addresses from getaddrinfo, like IPv6 only even
though only IPv4 is available:
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/-/issues/1041

It's a bit hard to reproduce, so I verified this by checking the timestamp
on calls to __check_pf manually. Without this patch it's stuck at 1, now
it's increasing on network changes as expected.
