Subject: [PATCH 47/66] nptl: Do not set signal mask on second setjmp return
 [BZ #28607]

__libc_signal_restore_set was in the wrong place: It also ran
when setjmp returned the second time (after pthread_exit or
pthread_cancel).  This is observable with blocked pending
signals during thread exit.

Fixes commit b3cae39dcbfa2432b3f3aa28854d8ac57f0de1b8
("nptl: Start new threads with all signals blocked [BZ #25098]").

(cherry picked from commit e186fc5a31e46f2cbf5ea1a75223b4412907f3d8)
