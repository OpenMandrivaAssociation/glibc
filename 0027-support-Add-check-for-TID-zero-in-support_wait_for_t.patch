Subject: [PATCH 27/66] support: Add check for TID zero in
 support_wait_for_thread_exit

Some kernel versions (observed with kernel 5.14 and earlier) can list
"0" entries in /proc/self/task.  This happens when a thread exits
while the task list is being constructed.  Treat this entry as not
present, like the proposed kernel patch does:

[PATCH] procfs: Do not list TID 0 in /proc/<pid>/task
<https://lore.kernel.org/all/8735pn5dx7.fsf@oldenburg.str.redhat.com/>

Fixes commit 032d74eaf6179100048a5bf0ce942e97dc8b9a60 ("support: Add
support_wait_for_thread_exit").
