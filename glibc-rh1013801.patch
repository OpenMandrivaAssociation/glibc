#
# This is related to bug 1013801 in that it fixes the problem
# by modifying the runtime. In bug 1013801 we have libselinux
# using pthread_atfork which pulls in libpthread, but we don't
# want that, we want libpthread to be pulled in only when
# actually needed by the application. This patch makes it
# possible to avoid requiring libpthread and still use
# pthread_atfork.
#
# The general idea for the design is in the leading comment
# in the source code.

+/* The standard design pattern for making it optional to link against
+   libpthread is to mark the function weak, test if the function
+   address is non-zero and call the function, otherwise use a fallback.
+   The problem with pthread_atfork is that there is no viable
+   fallback.  If you need to do something during fork it has to be done
+   via pthread_atfork.  This makes having libpthread optional and using
+   pthread_atfork impossible.  We make it possible by providing
+   pthread_atfork in libc_nonshared.a.  The real work of pthread_atfork
+   is done by __register_atfork which is already provided in
+   libc_nonshared.a.  It's included in libc_nonshared.a because
+   __dso_handle has to be unique to each DSO such that unloading the DSO
+   can unregister the atfork handlers.  We build pthread_atfork again
+   under a different file name and include it into libc_nonshared.a and
+   libc.a. We keep pthread_atfork in libpthread_nonshared.a and
+   libpthread.a for compatibility and completeness.
+
+   Applications that can't rely on a new glibc should use the following
+   code to optionally include libpthread and still register a function
+   via pthread_atfork i.e. use __register_atfork directly:
+
+   extern void *__dso_handle __attribute__ ((__weak__, __visibility__ ("hidden")));
+   extern int __register_atfork (void (*) (void), void (*) (void), void (*) (void), void *);
+
+   static int __app_atfork (void (*prepare) (void), void (*parent) (void), void (*child) (void))
+     {
+       return __register_atfork (prepare, parent, child,
+				 &__dso_handle == NULL ? NULL : __dso_handle);
+     }
+
+   This code requires glibc 2.3.2 or newer. Previous to 2.3.2 no such
+   interfaces exist and at that point is is impossible to have an
+   optional libpthread and call pthread_atfork.
+
+   This code adds no more ABI requirements than already exist since
+   __dso_handle and __register_atfork are already part of the ABI.  */
